I'm going to try putting up some Wolfram/Mathematica code into GitHub. I'm 
hoping that it is runnable or at least displayable. I will definitely
upload the notebook (or whatever file type is available on the player).
Whether I can get things going or not, I'm going to follow some of the 
presentation-on-github tutorials to make a Python version and display it 
here.

Look at the PDF and PNG versions of the Notebook (*.nb) files, since the
way that these Notebook files look when seen on GitHub is different from
what is seen on
